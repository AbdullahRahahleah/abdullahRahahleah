I have chosen Java as I have 2 years of experience and as a java a very robust.
in Java you can control the requests and how to handle them and how to deal with application sites.
I used a servlet to control the backend and JSP to control the from the end and how to display the values.

In this assignment, I learned how to deploy a whole project from the scratch.

I learned how to read using JSON in servlet and display the results in JSP.

Here is used :
Servlet, JSP, filters.
Here is used the jsp to display the records.
I used the filters to deal with every request come to /home page.
I used servlets as a controller.


In this project I have built the project using MVC design pattern, I saved the returned values in beans, and I created a created a models class which can handle any general requests (doing general business), also I created a  controller class to do my business.

Here you can see also a test case in the test package

I think we can make this site larger by displaying more and more data and provide a way to purchase tickets.
