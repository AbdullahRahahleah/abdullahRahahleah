I have choosed java as I have a 2 years of experience and as a java a very robust.
in Java you can control the requests and how to handle them and how to deal with application sites.
I used servlet to control the backend and jsP to control the from end and how to display the values.

In this assignment I learned how to deploy a whole project from the scratch.

I learned how to read using jSON in servlet and display the results in JSP.

Here is used :
Servlet, JSP, filters.
Here is used the jsp to display the records.
I used the filters to deal with every request come to /home page.
I used a servlets as a controller.

I think we can make this site larger by displaying more and more data and provide a way to purchase a tickets.
